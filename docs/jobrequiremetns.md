AI Engineer
Like other things at Faff, we do JDs differently. We feel exceptional people care deeply
about their work, and therefore, we think deeply about what we write here.
Building in consumer-tech is a lot like falling in love; slowly at first, then all at once.
Our Story:
We started in Sept 2024 with a thesis and a strong desire to solve for the Indian
consumers. We realised busy working professionals were spending several hours every
week on chores. Despite the popular narrative that “there’s an app for everything,” we
noticed that for more than 500 use cases no good solution existed. We wanted to offer
people a personal assistant that could do all these things for them. The traditional personal
assistant has several limitations — it is not affordable, has limited working hours, and has
limited intelligence and capabilities. It clicked to us that a lot of what a personal assistant
does (like calling, coordination, bookings, getting information) are exactly the kind of things
that can be automated using technology that has just hit an inflection point. We started out
by becoming the personal assistant for people, asking them what they needed help with.
People could hire us for Rs. 2000 per month to delegate any of their personal chores
including government work, household management, travel, appointments, and a lot more.
In the first three months, we did about 500 tasks and noticed that people found a lot of
value in having Faff as a service. They were using us week on week, renewing month on
month, and telling everyone they knew about us. In the next few months, we built our
operations team, internal playbooks, and training modules. We also built technology on top
of WhatsApp and internal tooling to make our operational team productive. Till now, we
have finished close to 15,000 tasks and have an active paying user base that is using us
weekly. The user love we have seen for our service makes us confident that there is a
deep unmet need waiting to be fulfilled. Even though we feel confident that we are onto
something, we are still a little far away from the final factor of what potentially could be one
of the most impactful consumer companies in this country. Nexus VP has decided to invest
over $2.5 million to help us in our journey. We are building our founding team to help us
find product-market fit in the next few months and then scale rapidly to get 100,000 paying
customers by the end of 2026. We feel there are several great Indian internet companies
yet to be built, and we have a shot at making one. If you would like to be early in this
journey and become an influential member of the story, this is likely the perfect time to join
us.
The Role:
There are 100 companies in the world building voice agents that will call a customer on
behalf of the restaurant. There is no one building voice agents that will call a restaurant on
behalf of the customer — except us. As the first AI Engineer, you will be building products
on the cutting edge of technology — voice agents, browser agents, memory, and more.
We want to scale from 12 tasks per executive (faffer) to over 100 per day. That
superhuman productivity is only possible by being on top of the AI curve and executing
with extreme urgency. We already have voice agents in production, automating around
half of the calls today. We work closely with our ops team and solve their problems by
building tools for them. You’ll be the owner of your own project and work with the rest of
the team to find deep pain points and solve them. We’ve built only 1% of the product’s
capabilities — if you like building beautiful software that helps the end consumer directly,
this is the right place to be.
Ideal Candidate:
The right person for this role will be a great problem solver, quick learner, and strong
executor. They will be able to pick up new technologies and ship products in a matter of
weeks. We don't have strict constraints on past experience, but we believe the right kind of
person will have 1–3 years of professional work experience and solid proof of work. There
are two personas we are looking for: 1. Deeply Technical: - Comfortable with Python
(FastAPI) and GCP / AWS. - Built live AI-native projects with significant traction. -
Experience in building and maintaining AI agents (custom orchestrators, not LangChain). -
Understanding of classical ML models and modern approaches like tool-augmented
reasoning and fine-tuning (e.g., QLoRA). - (Good to have) experience with voice or
browser agents (beyond demos). 2. Technical + Product/Business/Design: - Ahead of
the curve in AI adoption and experimentation. - Built an end-to-end working product with
customer traction. - Strong product sense and proven execution ability. - Reasonable
understanding of how language models work.
Offer Details:
We’re based out of HSR, Bangalore. This is a strictly in-person role. This is an important
founding team role. You can expect to work 70+ hours every week. For the right
candidate, we will be able to match their current salary. Additionally, this role will come
with a significant equity component.
